I am an undergraduate student at Peking University. My research interests are primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and focus on robustness in NLP and computational creativity.

*I am actively seeking for PhD opportunities starting in 2022 Fall. If you are interested in me, please do not hesitate to contact me: yx DOT zhang AT pku DOT edu DOT cn*
