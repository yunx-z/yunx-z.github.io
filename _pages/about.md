I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at the [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/), University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

I work on natural language processing (NLP), with a research focus on knowledge and reasoning in large language models (LLMs).

***I am looking for 2024 summer research internship opportunities!***
