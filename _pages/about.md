I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at University of Michigan – Ann Arbor. My advisor is Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html). 

My current research focus lies in knowledge-grounded reasoning models for natural language processing. I am also interested in natural language generation and robustness in NLP. 

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

Please check out my CV [here](https://github.com/yunx-z/yunx-z.github.io/raw/master/files/Personal_CV.pdf).
