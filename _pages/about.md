I am a senior undergraduate student at Peking University advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). I also intern at the [Web Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing Group](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) of National University of Singapore, where I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). I am interested in researching *reliable* natural language processing technologies that deal with diversified, real-world textual data. Particularly, I work on robustness in NLP and creative language understanding/generation.   

*I am actively seeking for PhD opportunities starting in 2022 Fall.*
