I am an undergraduate student at Peking University. My research interests are primarily in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and focus on robustness in NLP and computational creativity.

*I am actively seeking for potential Ph.D. opportunity in Computer Science for Fall 2022. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you’re interested!*

This site is under construction. Stay tuned for my updates!
