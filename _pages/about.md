I am a 4th year CS Ph.D. candidate at the [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/), University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

I work on LLM reasoning and agents.

# News
* 2025-11: Thrilled to receive **NeurIPS Travel Award**!
* 2025-10: Check out our recent work, [ThinkLogit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09354), on efficient long chain-of-thought reasoning.
* 2025-09: [MLRC-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09702), which focuses on the evaluation of AI research agents, has been accepted to **NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track**. See you in San Diego!"
