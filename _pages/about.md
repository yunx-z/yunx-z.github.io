I am a senior undergraduate student at Peking University (PKU) advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). I also interned at National University of Singapore (NUS), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/). I am interested in reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that deal with diversified, real-world textual data. Specifically, I work on robustness in NLP and creative language understanding/generation.  

**I am actively seeking for PhD opportunities starting in 2022 Fall.**
