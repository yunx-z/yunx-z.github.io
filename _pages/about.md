I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at the [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/), University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from Peking University, advised by Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

My research aims to reduce hallucinations and improve the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs).

# News
* 2024-05: One paper is accepted to **Findings of ACL 2024** on [self-correction of small LMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17140)! See you in Bangkok, Thailand.
* 2024-05: Pleased to start my 1st PhD internship at [Microsoft Research, Montreal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/). I will work with [Eric Yuan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/eryua/) and [Alessandro Sordoni](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/alsordon/).
* 2023-10: One paper is accepted to **EMNLP 2023** on [knowledge conflicts for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14393.pdf)!
